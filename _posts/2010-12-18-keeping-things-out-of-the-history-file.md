title: keeping things out of your shell history file
teaser: "tl;dr: add a space before you type your command"
---

TIL that adding a space to the very beginning of a command line will keep it out of your history file.

It was just some random thing I read and someone said that the space keeps it out of the bash history.

As someone who's a semi-recent bash -> zsh convert, I can confirm that the beginning space trick works in zsh.

Yay.
